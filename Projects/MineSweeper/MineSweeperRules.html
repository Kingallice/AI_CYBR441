            <h3>Explanation of Environment</h3>
            <p>
                Each Minesweeper cell is stored in a 2D array on initialization. Another 2D array updates cells the player is able to see.
                In the second array, named visibleCells, each cell stores the number of neighbouring mines as its value. The user is also
                able to determine the number of neighbouring bombs with the numUncoveredBombs(xIndex, yIndex) function.
